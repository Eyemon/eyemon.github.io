        <h1>It's me: Simon!</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a 31 year old aspiring functional analist with a history in retail banking but a passion for IT. I studied teaching secundary education at HoGent. I come from a family of five, all boys, of which four now work in IT and one works as a filmmaker.
          I was lucky enough to marry my highschool sweetheart who gave me two beautiful children. We've been together 15 years now but we only got married in 2018.
          I've been doing 'computer stuff' for as long as I can remember, I'm happy I now get the chance to do this in my professional life as well.

        <h3>Work & family life</h3>
        <p>
        I was lucky enough to marry my highschool sweetheart who gave me two beautiful children. My <a class="secret-link" href="secret-wife-tribute.html">wife's</a> a construction engineer doing technical/energy calculations for new constructions and renovations. She's a whole lot smarter than I am, but I caught her early enough so she's stuck with me!
        I have 2 boys, a 3year-old and a nearly 1year-old. They're wonderful, even though they've taken up every bit of free time I used to have.
        </p>
          <br/>

        <h3>What I do for fun</h3>
        <p>
          I used to have a lot of hobbies. Now I have two children and a dad-bod. I exercised five times a week of which two were Taekwon-do practices and three were running 5 kilometers. Running longer distances is too tedious! I also dance salsa with my wife, though now it's more about dodging the kids than it is actual dancing. In the evenings I like to play video games, this is the only hobby I've been able to keep up throughout the whole family thing.
