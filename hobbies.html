          <h2>Taekwondo</h2>
          <p class="hobby-text">Taekwondo is a korean martial art which you can learn about by watching youtube videos or reading wikipedia! I'm just writing this entry to tell you why I like it! To start off, nothing brings clarity of mind like getting punched lovingly in the face by a good friend. But on a more serious note, martial arts train the body as well as the mind. It teaches humility and respect. Taekwondo has 4 disciplines: </p>
          <ul class="hobby-list">
            <li><strong>Tul: </strong>a style practice in which practicioners run a certain pattern.</li>
            <li><strong>Sparring:</strong> it's exactly what it sounds like. We wear protection on hands and feet and then have free sparring (semi-contact).</li>
            <li><strong>Power breaking:</strong> Using different techniques to break wooden or specially designed pvc planks.</li>
            <li><strong>Hosinsul:</strong> self-defence. Going from freeing oneself 'gently' to incapacitating or restraining opponents.</li>

          <h3>Video Games</h3>
          <p class="hobby-text">I used to play a lot of video games, maybe even a bit too much. This has lessened severely the last couple of years though. Nowadays my main preference is virtual reality games as they add a whole new level of immersion.</p>
